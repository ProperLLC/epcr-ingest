REST URL Endpoints Design:

POST /incident
	- accept text/json
	- single incident record
	- return appropriate HTTP code on success/failure

POST /incidents
	- accept text/json
	- array of incident records
	- return appropriate HTTP code on success/failure
	- atomic operation - if on doc fails, all fail
